# AVO Explorer v4

Update of the old [AVO Explorer notebook](https://github.com/aadm/avo_explorer), which I simplified and [converted to a Streamlit app in v3](https://github.com/aadm/avo_explorer_v3).

In this new version (July 2024) I added the possibility to show angle range contribution using Shuey and Hilterman approximation. 

I also converted the plotting routine to matplotlib as I still feel intimidated / constrained by Altair.
